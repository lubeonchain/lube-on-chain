Founder’s Letter

hello and gm,

with this being my first Founders Letter i figured this should help you understand me and what im doing. 

now heres the hook...

played sports my whole life. obsessed was an understatement.
playing sports in university. this taught me to compete. 
pandemic hits. sports cancelled.
all university students sent home.
me: im going to make the best of every single day 
also me: funds a td ameritrade account and starts reading everything / anything on investopedia.
pandemic blows over. slow grind to normalcy. sports end at university and enters the freedom of my schedule.

need to keep busy. landed job from 10pm-6am doing table games surverillance. 
40hrs counting cards at night. final university classes during the day. 
driving between work and university to me was wasted time. something i hate.
usher in bitcoin fundamentals. by the investors podcast. that was my behind the wheel pass time.
senior year at university means capstone. research. thesis. right?
i wrote mine on digital assets in '22. professor fails me for final paper. gave me passing credit. she hated the whole idea.
how could such an academic not understand perfect money?? this was humorus. 

6am sun is rising. foot of fresh snowfall overnight in boston. ruined leather shoes from the slush. 
pry open the door of my iced over car. a freezing zombie after the night shift. song comes through the speakers.
we always dream about this better life, this better life. on repeat via the radio.
then and there. it hit me. there was a better life.
a life of not working 24/7. freezing my ass off. struggling to get by.
it didnt have to be eights always split. +9 true count. double after split veruses dealer 6. econ 504 from 9:40-11. political science from 11-12. and chem lab from 3:40-5. 
3 hours of sleep. rinse and repeat. 
in fact it could be the opposite.
a vibrant life. kick start a fulfilling career. explore new opportunities. see the world.

not long after. boom. change of plans. opt for the better life. 
sunshine. fresh opportunity. career. 
packed my car and drove 19 hours. got the keys to my apartment. rented a uhual. bought built and furnished my apartment. unpacked my car.
going on 24 hours no sleep. signed gym membership. wifi working. grocery shop.
no network. no contacts. no sense of direction. just an assignment to show up for work the coming monday to start my career in financial services.
within 36 hours. moved across the country. set up my new homebase in florida.
this is how fast people can move.

not all smooth sailing. hurricane lands in the first month. learned to appreciate suply chains and logistcs quick. cockroaches and lizards infultrate my apartment. 
everything else seemingly got better after this. 
built out an unbelieveable network. gained my footing with work. large broker dealer. 
only catch for this better life meant $24 per hour. haircut from boston. honest to say the least. 
first few months were incredible. low stress. work 8-4. honest check. dollar drinks on the beach. local gym was cool.
simple. easy. this was the better life. 

the peaceful bliss of the better life lasted all of five months. watching the digital asset ecosystem take off eoy '23 into '24.
focus shifted to bitcoin and solana. 
dissasociated with the large broker dealer. on my own in florida. i pivoted into the digital asset ecosystem. 
surviving off of solana projects. operating through x and telegram. it was a time to be alive. 
something about being profitable on solana gave me confidence. 
enough confidence to convince a talent aquisition woman at a major bank to give me a trading role.
